<p>“who are you?” you ask?</p>
<p>well you can call me <strong>Sh3ll-41</strong> though that is my
username i used online. i like doing some techy stuff, to be honest i
didn’t do much in that nor some geeky stuff like making a home server,
NAS, or rasberry pi project. i just using my slow and old trusty asus
laptop. model e202s if i’m not mistaken. this rig only run on intel
celeron N3060 with 2.4Ghz <strong>MAX</strong> so i cannot run heavy
duty task on my laptop. this machine run on 2GB RAM so.. it is what it
is, i want a Operating System that run lightweight on this machine.
well, currently i use void linux with dwm installed. enough with that,
maybe later i show you more about my machine.</p>
<p>well, thats it for my introduction. i hope you like my site. well
it’s currently kinda boring and flat. i’m working on that.</p>
<p>Thanks for the Visit !</p>
